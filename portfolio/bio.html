					Hi, my name is Michael DiGrigoli. I am a second year student at Rochester Institute of technology. I was born in Greer, South Carolina and raised in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Western Massachusetts. I graduated 5th in my class of 180 students from Taconic High School class of 2015.
					I am currently working on my Game Design and Development degree and have yet to have any work in my field, but am eager to change that. I've loved video games since I first discovered them in elementary school, and have been coding since my freshman year in high school.
					I'm good at what I do, although not exactly graceful -as I'm sure you can tell by this site- and I'd love to work for you.
				</p>
