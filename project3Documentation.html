				My project was mainly built using svg and javascript. Other than the index and gameover pages there wasn't really any html or css used. I wrote the majority of it myself, however I had to look up how to use local storage, how to redirect to another page, how to include audio, and how to properly use arrays in javascript. In terms of skills I learned how to
				manipulate the positioning of polygons in an svg, which was more difficult than I though it would be because polygons dont have an x or y value just a list of points.<br />
				For future improvement I would like to make the objects move a little more smoothly and make the enemy ai adjust to having less units in their row.
